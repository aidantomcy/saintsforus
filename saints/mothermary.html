            Mother Mary (8 September 18 BC-33 AD) was a first-century Galilean
            Jewish woman of Nazareth, the wife
            <br />of Joseph and the mother of Lord Jesus Christ according to the
            Canonical Gospels and the Quran. The <br />Gospels of Matthew and
            Luke in the New Testament and the Quran describe Mary as a virgin.
            In Matthew <br />and Luke, she is betrothed to Joseph. According to
            Christian theology, she conceived Jesus through the <br />Holy
            Spirit while still a virgin. She accompanied Joseph to Bethlehem,
            where Jesus was born. Catholic <br />and Eastern Christian teachings
            claim that at the end of her earthly life, God raised her body
            directly <br />into heaven; this is known in the Christian West as
            the Assumption of Mary.

          <h2>Names and titles</h2>
          <p>
            In Christianity, Mary is commonly referred to as the Virgin Mary, in
            accordance with the belief that he
            <br />Holy Spirit impregnated her, thereby conceiving her first-born
            son Jesus miraculously. The word "until" <br />has inspired
            considerable analysis on whether Joseph and Mary produced siblings
            after the birth of Jesus <br />or not. Among her many other names
            and titles are the Blessed Virgin Mary (often abbreviated to "BVM",
            or <br />"BMV" after the Latin "Beata Maria Virgo"), Saint Mary
            (occasionally), the Mother of God (primarily in <br />Western
            Christianity), the Theotokos (primarily in Eastern Christianity),
            Our Lady (Medieval Italian: Madonna), <br />and Queen of Heaven
            (Regina caeli; see also here), although the title "queen of heaven"
            was for centuries <br />before used as an epithet for a number of
            ancient sky-goddesses, such as Nin-anna, Astarte, Ishtar and
            <br />Astoreth, the Canaanite sky-goddess worshipped during the
            Hebrew prophet Jeremiah's lifetime.
          </p>
          <h2>Birth of Jesus</h2>
          <p>
            According to the author of the gospel according to Luke, a decree of
            the Roman Emperor Augustus required
            <br />that Joseph return to his hometown of Bethlehem to register
            for a Roman census; see Census of Quirinius. <br />While he was
            there with Mary, she gave birth to Jesus; but because there was no
            place for them in the inn, <br />she used a manger as a cradle.
            After eight days, he was circumcised according to Jewish law and
            named "Jesus <br />(Yeshu'a), which means "Yahweh is salvation".
            After Mary continued in the "blood of her purifying" another
            <br />33 days, for a total of 40 days, she brought her burnt
            offering and sin offering to the Temple in Jerusalem <br />[Luke
            2:22] so the priest could make atonement for her.[Leviticus 12:1-8]
            They also presented Jesus - "As it <br />is written in the law of
            the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to
            the Lord" (Luke <br />2:23 other verses). After the prophecies of
            Simeon and the prophetess Anna in Luke 2:25-38, the family "returned
            <br />into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth".
          </p>
          <h2>In the life of Jesus</h2>
          <p>
            Mary was present when, at her suggestion, Jesus worked his first
            miracle during a wedding at Cana by
            <br />turning water into wine. [Jn 2:1-11] Subsequently, there are
            events when Mary is present along with James <br />Joseph, Simon,
            and Judas, called Jesus' brothers, and unnamed sisters. Following
            Jerome, the Church Fathers <br />interpreted the words translated as
            "brother" and "sister" as referring to close relatives. The
            hagiography <br />of Mary and the Holy Family can be contrasted with
            other material in the Gospels. These references include <br />an
            incident which can be interpreted as Jesus rejecting his family in
            the New Testament: "And his mother and <br />his brothers arrived,
            and standing outside, they sent in a message asking for him […] And
            looking at those who <br />sat in a circle around him, Jesus said,
            'These are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the will of God
            is <br />my brother, and sister, and mother'."
          </p>
          <h2>Feasts</h2>
          <p>
            The earliest feasts that relate to Mary grew out of the cycle of
            feasts that celebrated the Nativity of
            <br />Jesus. Given that according to the Gospel of Luke (Luke
            2:22-40), 40 days after the birth of Jesus, along <br />with the
            Presentation of Jesus at the Temple Mary was purified according to
            Jewish customs, the Feast of <br />the Purification began to be
            celebrated by the 5th century, and became the "Feast of Simeon" in
            Byzantium. <br />In the 7th and 8th centuries, four more Marian
            feasts were established in Eastern Christianity. In the West,
            <br />a feast dedicated to Mary, just before Christmas was
            celebrated in the Churches of Milan and Ravenna in Italy <br />in
            the 7th century. The four Roman Marian feasts of Purification,
            Annunciation, Assumption and Nativity of Mary <br />were gradually
            and sporadically introduced into England by the 11th century.
