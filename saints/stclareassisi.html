            St. Clare of Assisi (16 July 1194-11 August 1253) is an Italian
            saint and one of the first followers
            <br />of Francis of Assisi. As a child, Clare was devoted to prayer.
            Although there is no mention of this <br />in any historical record,
            it is assumed that Clare was to be married in line with the family
            tradition. <br />However, as a teenager, she heard Francis preach
            during a Lenten service in the Church of San Giorgio <br />at Assisi
            and asked him to help her live according to the Gospel. On the
            evening of Palm Sunday, 20 March <br />1212, she left her father's
            house and accompanied by her aunt Bianca and another companion,
            proceeded to <br />the Chapel of Poriuncula to meet Francis. There,
            her hair was cut, and she exchanged her rich gown for a <br />plain
            robe and veil. She founded the Order of Poor Ladies, a monastic
            religious order for women in the <br />Franciscan tradition, and
            wrote their Rule of Life, the first set of monastic guidelines known
            to have <br />been written by a woman. Following her death, the
            order she founded was renamed in her honour as the Order <br />of
            Saint Clare, commonly referred to today as the Poor Clares.
          </p>
          <h2>Life</h2>
          <p>
            Francis placed Clare in the convent of the Benedictine nuns of San
            Paulo, near Bastia. Her father
            <br />attempted to force her to return home. She clung to the altar
            of the church and threw aside her veil <br />to show her cropped
            hair. She resisted each attempt, professing that she would have no
            other husband <br />but Jesus Christ. In order to provide the
            greater solitude Clare desired, a few days later Francis sent
            <br />her to Sant' Angelo in Panzo, another monastery of the
            Benedictine nuns on one of the flanks of Subasio. <br />Clare was
            soon joined by her sister Catarina, who took the name Agnes. They
            remained with the Benedictines <br />until a small dwelling was
            built for them next to the church of San Damiano, which Francis had
            repaired <br />some years earlier. Other women joined them, and they
            were known as the "Poor Ladies of San Damiano". They <br />lived a
            simple life of poverty, austerity and seclusion from the world,
            according to a Rule which Francis <br />gave them as a Second Order
            (Poor Clares).
          </p>
          <h2>The Order of Saint Clare</h2>
          <p>
            San Damiano became the centre of Clare's new religious order, which
            was known in her lifetime as the "Order
            <br />of Poor Ladies of San Damiano". San Damiano is traditionally
            considered the first house of this order; it <br />may have been
            affiliated with an existing network of women's religious houses
            organised by Hugolino (who <br />later became Pope Gregory IX).
            Hugolino wanted San Damiano as part of the order he founded because
            of the <br />prestige of Clare's monastery. San Damiano emerged as
            the most important house in the order, and Clare became <br />its
            undisputed leader. By 1263, just ten years after Clare's death, the
            order had become known as the Order <br />of Saint Clare. In 1228,
            when Gregory IX offered Clare a dispensation from the vow of strict
            poverty, she <br />replied: "I need to be absolved from my sins, but
            not from the obligation of following Christ." Accordingly, <br />the
            Pope granted them the Privilegium Pauperitatis — that nobody could
            oblige them to accept any possession.
          </p>
          <h2>Death</h2>
          <p>
            On 9 August 1253, two days before her death, the papal bull Solet
            annuere of Pope Innocent IV confirmed
            <br />that Clare's rule would serve as the governing rule for
            Clare's Order of Poor Ladies. Her remains were <br />interred at the
            chapel of San Giorgio while a church to hold her remains was being
            constructed. At her <br />funeral, Pope Innocent IV insisted the
            friars perform the Office for the Virgin Saints as opposed to the
            <br />Office for the Dead. This move by Pope Innocent ensured that
            the canonization process for Clare would <br />begin shortly after
            her funeral. Pope Innocent was cautioned by multiple advisers
            against having the Office <br />for the Virgin Saints performed at
            Clare's funeral. The most vocal of these advisers was Cardinal
            Raynaldus <br />who would later become Pope Alexander IV, who in two
            years time would canonize Clare. At Pope Innocent's <br />request
            the canonization process for Clare began immediately. While the
            whole process took two years, the <br />examination of Clare's
            miracles took just six days. On 26 September 1255, Pope Alexander IV
            canonized Clare <br />as Saint Clare of Assisi.
          </p>
          <h2>Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            Clare was canonized on 26 September 1255 by Pope Alexander IV, and
            her feast day was immediately inserted
            <br />in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 12 August,
            the day after her death, as 11 August was <br />already assigned to
            Saints Tiburtius and Susanna, two 3rd-century Roman martyrs. The
            celebration was ranked <br />as a Double (as in the Tridentine
            Calendar) or, in the terminology adopted in 1960, a Third-Class
            Feast (as <br />in the General Roman Calendar of 1960). The 1969
            calendar revision removed the feast of Tiburtius and Susanna
            <br />from the calendar, finally allowing the memorial of Saint
            Clare to be celebrated on 11 August, the day of her <br />death.
            Construction of the Basilica di Santa Chiara began a year after
            Clare's canonization, and her remains <br />were transferred there
            on 3 October 1260 from the church of St George, also in Assisi. Her
            bones are now in <br />the crypt at the Basilica, having been
            rediscovered in 1850.
