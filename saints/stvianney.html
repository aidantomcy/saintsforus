          <p>
            St. Vianney (8 May 1786-4 August 1859) was a French Catholic priest
            who is venerated in the Catholic
            <br />Church as a saint and the patron saint of parish priests. He
            is often referred to as the "Cure d'Ars" <br />(i.e. the parish
            priest of Ars) and is internationally known for his priestly and
            pastoral work in his <br />parish in Ars, France, because of the
            radical spiritual transformation of the community and its
            surroundings. <br />Catholics attribute this to his saintly life,
            mortification, persevering ministry in the sacrament of
            <br />confession and ardent devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.
            Vianney was born in the French town of Dardilly <br />and was
            baptized on the same day. His parents, Matthieu Vianney and Marie,
            had six children, of whom St. <br />Vianney was the fourth. The
            Vianneys were devout Catholics who helped the poor. Vianney's
            paternal <br />grandparents once gave hospitality to St. Benedict
            Joseph Labre, the patron saint of the homeless, who <br />passed
            through Dardilly on his pilgrimage to Rome in 1770.

          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <p>
            By 1790, the anticlerical Terror phase of the French Revolution
            forced many loyal priests to hide from
            <br />the regime in order to carry out the sacraments in their
            parish. Even though to do so had been declared <br />illegal, the
            Vianneys traveled to distant farms to attend Masses celebrated on
            the run. Realizing that <br />such priests risked their lives day by
            day, Vianney began to look upon them as heroes. He received his
            <br />First Communion catiterm instructions in a private home from
            two nuns whose communities had been dissolved <br />during the
            Revolution. He made his first communion at the age of 13 in a
            neighbor's kitchen; during the <br />Mass, the windows were covered
            so that the light of the candles could not be seen from the outside.
          </p>
          <h2>Cure (priest) of Ars</h2>
          <p>
            In 1818, shortly after the death of Balley, Vianney was appointed
            parish priest of the parish of Ars,
            <br />a town of 230 inhabitants. When Vianney's bishop first
            assigned him to Ars, he got lost trying to find <br />the town. Two
            young men tending flocks in the fields pointed him in the right
            direction. With Catherine <br />Lassagne and Benedicta Lardet, he
            established La Providence, a home for girls. As parish priest,
            Vianney <br />realized that the Revolution's aftermath had resulted
            in religious ignorance and indifference, due to the
            <br />devastation wrought on the Catholic Church in France. At the
            time, Sundays in rural areas were spent working <br />in the fields,
            or dancing and drinking in taverns. Vianney spent time in the
            confessional and gave homilies <br />against blasphemy and paganic
            dancing. If his parishioners did not give up this dancing, he
            refused them <br />absolution.
          </p>
          <h2>Later years</h2>
          <p>
            Vianney came to be known internationally, and people from distant
            places began travelling to consult him
            <br />as early as 1827. "By 1855, the number of pilgrims had reached
            20,000 a year. During the last ten years <br />of his life, he spent
            16 to 18 hours a day in the confessional. Even the bishop forbade
            him to attend the <br />annual retreats of the diocesan clergy
            because of the souls awaiting him yonder". He spent at least 11 or
            <br />12 hours a day in the confessional during winter, and up to 16
            in the summer. In his article "How does the <br />Church Respond to
            Suicide?" Shaun McAfee references an incident described in the book
            Cure of Ars: "...a woman <br />...told....Vianney that she was
            devastated because her husband had committed suicide. She wanted to
            approach <br />the great priest but his line often lasted for hours
            and she could not reach him. She was ready to give up <br />and in a
            moment of mystical insight that only a great saint can
            receive,...Vianney exclaimed through the crowd, <br />"He is saved!"
            The woman was incredulous so the saint repeated, stressing each
            word, "I tell you he is saved. <br />He is in Purgatory, and you
            must pray for him. Between the parapet of the bridge and the water
            he had time to <br />make an act of contrition."
          </p>
          <h2>Death and veneration</h2>
          <p>
            On 4 August 1859, Vianney died at the age of 73. The bishop presided
            over his funeral with 300 priests
            <br />and more than 6,000 people in attendance. Before he was
            buried, Vianney's body was fitted with a wax <br />mask. On 3
            October 1874 Pope Pius IX proclaimed him "venerable"; on 8 January
            1905, Pope Pius X declared <br />him Blessed and proposed him as a
            model to the parochial clergy. In 1925 John Mary Vianney was
            canonized <br />by Pope Pius XI, who in 1929 made him patron saint
            of parish priests. In 1928 his feast day was inserted <br />into the
            General Roman Calendar for celebration on 9 August. Pope John
            XXIII's 1960 revision, in which the <br />Vigil of Saint Lawrence
            had a high rank, moved the feast to 8 August. Finally, the 1969
            revision placed it <br />on 4 August, the day of his death.
