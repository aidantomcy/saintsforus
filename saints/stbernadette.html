            St. Bernadette (7 January 1844-16 April 1879) was the firstborn
            daughter of a miller from Lourdes in the
            <br />department of Hautes-Pyrenees in France. She is best known for
            experiencing Marian Apparitions of a "young lady" <br />who asked
            for a Chapel to be built at the nearby cave-grotto at Massabielle.
            These apparitions are said to have <br />occured between 11 February
            and 16 July 1858, and the woman who appeared to her identified
            herself as the <br />"Immaculate Conception." After a canonical
            investigation, Bernadette's reports were eventually declared "worthy
            of <br />belief" on 18 February 1862, and the Marian Apparition
            became known as Our Lady of Lourdes. Since her death, her <br />body
            has apparently remained internally incorrupt. On 8 December 1933,
            Pope Pius XI declared Bernadette a saint.

          <h2>Early Stages of Her Life</h2>
          <p>
            Marie Bernarde Soubirous was the daughter of Francois Soubirous
            (1807-1871), a miller, and Louise
            <br />(nee Casterot; 1825-1866), a laundress. Soubirous was born on
            7 January 1844 and baptized at the <br />local parish church, St.
            Pierre's, on 9 January, her parents' wedding anniversary. Her
            godmother <br />was Bernarde Casterot, her mother's sister, a
            moderately wealthy widow who owned a tavern. Hard <br />times had
            fallen on France and the family lived in extreme poverty. She
            contracted cholera as a <br />toddler and suffered severe asthma for
            the rest of her life. Soubirous attended the day school
            <br />conducted by the Sisters of Charity and Christian Instruction
            from Nevers. Contrary to a belief <br />popularized by Hollywood
            films, Soubirous learned very little French, only studying French in
            <br />school after age 13. At that time she could read and write
            very little due to her frequent illness.
          </p>

          <h2>Visions</h2>
          <p>
            On 11 February 1858, Soubirous, then aged 14, was out gathering
            firewood with her sister Toinette and a friend
            <br />near the grotto of Massabielle (Tuta de Massavielha) when she
            experienced her first vision. While the other <br />girls crossed
            the little stream in front of the grotto and walked on, Soubirous
            stayed behind, looking for a <br />place to cross where she wouldn't
            get her stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her shoes off in
            order <br />to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when
            she heard the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. <br />A wild
            rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the
            niche, or rather the dark alcove <br />behind it, "came a dazzling
            light, and a white figure". This was the first of 18 visions of what
            she referred <br />to as aquero , Gascon Occitan for "that". In
            later testimony, she called it "a small young lady" (uo petito
            <br />damizelo). Her sister and her friend stated that they had seen
            nothing. On 14 February, after Sunday Mass, <br />Soubirous, with
            her sister Marie and some other girls, returned to the grotto.
            Soubirous knelt down immediately <br />saying she saw the apparition
            again. When one of the girls threw holy water at the niche and
            another threw a <br />rock from above that shattered on the ground,
            the apparition disappeared. On her next visit, 18 February,
            <br />Soubirous said that "the vision" asked her to return to the
            grotto every day for a fortnight.
          </p>
          <h2>Later Years and Death</h2>
          <p>
            On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious
            habit of a postulant and joined the
            <br />Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at Nevers. The Mother
            Superior at the time gave her the name <br />Marie-Bernarde in honor
            of her godmother who was named "Bernarde". As Patricia A. McEachern
            observes, <br />"Bernadette was devoted to Saint Bernard, her patron
            saint; she copied long texts related to him in <br />notebooks and
            on bits of paper. Unfortunately, Soubirous's childhood bout of
            "cholera left...[Bernadette] <br />with severe, chronic asthma, and
            eventually she contracted tuberculosis of the lungs and bones."
            <br />For several months prior to her death, she was unable to take
            an active part in convent life. She eventually <br />died of her
            long-term illness at the age of 35 on 16 April 1879 (the Wednesday
            after Easter), while praying <br />the holy rosary. On her deathbed,
            as she suffered from severe pain and in keeping with the Virgin
            Mary's <br />admonition of "Penance, Penance, Penance," Bernadette
            proclaimed that "all this is good for Heaven!" Her <br />final words
            were, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me, a poor sinner, a poor
            sinner".
          </p>
          <h2>Reorganization of the Franciscan Order</h2>
          <p>
            The growing order of friars was divided into provinces; groups were
            sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and
            <br />Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the
            martyrdom of five brothers in Morocco, Francis returned <br />to
            Italy via Venice. Cardinal Ugolino di Conti was then nominated by
            the pope as the protector of the order. <br />Another reason for
            Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at
            an unprecedented rate <br />compared to previous religious orders,
            but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this
            growth <br />and had little more to govern it than Francis' example
            and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared <br />a
            new and more detailed Rule, the "First Rule" or "Rule Without a
            Papal Bull" (Regula prima, Regula non bullata), <br />which again
            asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it
            also introduced greater institutional <br />structure, though this
            was never officially endorsed by the pope.
