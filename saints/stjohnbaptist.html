            John the Baptist (1st century BC - c.AD 30) was an itinerant
            preacher active in the area of the Jordan
            <br />River in the early 1st century AD. He is also known as John
            the Forerunner in Christianity, John the <br />Immerser in some
            Baptist Christian traditions, and Prophet Yahya in Islam. He is
            sometimes alternatively <br />referred to as John the Baptizer. John
            is mentioned by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus and revered as
            <br />a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Baha'i
            Faith, the Druze Faith, and Mandaeism. He is <br />considered to be
            a prophet of God by all of these faiths, and is honoured as a saint
            in many Christian <br />denominations. According to the New
            Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself,
            <br />and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of
            Jesus. Jesus himself identifies John as <br />"Elijah who is to
            come", which is a direct reference to the Book of Malachi (Malachi
            4:5), that has been <br />confirmed by the angel who announced
            John's birth to his father, Zechariah. According to the Gospel of
            Luke, <br />John and Jesus were relatives.
          </p>
          <h2>Gospel Narratives</h2>
          <p>
            John the Baptist is mentioned in all four canonical Gospels and the
            non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes.
            <br />The Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew and Luke) describe John
            baptising Jesus; in the Gospel of John this is <br />implied in John
            1:32. The Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfillment of a
            prophecy from the Book of Isaiah <br />(in fact, a conflation of
            texts from Isaiah, Malachi and Exodus) about a messenger being sent
            ahead, and a voice <br />crying out in the wilderness. John is
            described as wearing clothes of camel's hair, living on locusts and
            wild <br />honey. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the
            forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who
            <br />will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit. The
            Gospel of Matthew account begins with the same modified
            <br />quotation from Isaiah, moving the Malachi and Exodus material
            to later in the text, where it is quoted by Jesus. <br />The
            description of John is taken directly from Mark ("clothing of
            camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist, <br />and his
            food was locusts and wild honey"), along with the proclamation that
            one was coming who would baptize with <br />the Holy Spirit "and
            fire". The Gospel of Luke adds an account of John's infancy,
            introducing him as the miraculous <br />son of Zechariah, an old
            priest, and his wife Elizabeth, who was past menopause and therefore
            unable to have <br />children.
          </p>
          <h2>The Baptism in the Jordan</h2>
          <p>
            John was a very wise and hard-working person. One day, while he was
            in the desert, God spoke to
            <br />him and told him about Jesus, the Saviour who will free people
            from their sins. Then, John preached <br />to people preparing for
            the coming of the Lord Jesus. John told people to change their ways.
            He said <br />those who had two sets of clothes were to give away
            one to the needy. He also told the tax collectors <br />not to
            collect extra money and the soldiers to avoid violence. All those
            who heard John wondered if <br />he was the saviour. To this, John
            said that he only baptisd with water and Jesus, who was coming,
            <br />will baptise them with the Holy Spirit. When Jesus came to the
            river Jordan, Jesus asked John to <br />baptise him too. But John
            refused as he knew that Jesus was the Son of God. John asked Jesus
            why He <br />had come to him to be baptised. Jesus explained that
            John had to baptise Him so that he fullfills <br />the Word of God.
            John obeyed Jesus and baptised him in the river. Just as Jesus was
            baptised, the <br />Heavens opened. The Holy Spirit, in the form of
            a dove, rested upon Jesus. A voice from Heaven said, <br />"This is
            my beloved Son who will fulfill my promise to the people."
          </p>
          <h2>Imprisonment and Death</h2>
          <p>
            Princess Herodias, King Herod's daughter-in-law, hated John and
            requested for him to be thrown in
            <br />prison. King Herod knew Johhn was a holy man and liked
            listening to him, but he gave in to Herodias's <br />request and
            imprisoned John. John's disciples were disturbed. They asked Jesus
            whether He was truly <br />the Messiah. Jesus told them to tell John
            all the miracles that they saw him do. John was happy when
            <br />disciples told him about Jesus's miracles. Later, on King
            Herod's birthday, a large banquet was held <br />in his honour. At
            the banquet, Princess Herodias's daughter, Salome, danced before the
            guests. King <br />Herod was so pleased that he promised to give her
            whatever she requested. She requested for John the <br />Baptist's
            head on a plate, as her mother hated John and Salome wanted to
            please her mother. King Herod <br />was upset, but he had promised
            to give whatever she asked. He ordered the executioners to behead
            John. <br />They did so and brought John's head on a platter. Herod
            presented it to Salome and she gave it to her mother.
          </p>
          <h2>Relics</h2>
          <p>
            Matthew 14:12 records that "his disciples came and took away
            [John's] body and buried it." Theologian
            <br />Joseph Benson refers to a belief that they managed to do so
            because "it seems that the body had been <br />thrown over the
            prison walls, without burial, probably by order of Herodias." The
            burial place of John <br />the Baptist's body has traditionally been
            said to be at the site of a Byzantine church later converted
            <br />into a mosque, the Nabi Yahya (Prophet John) Mosque in
            Sebastia, currently part of the State of Palestine, <br />and
            mention is made of his relics being honoured there around the middle
            of the 4th century. What became <br />of the head of John the
            Baptist is difficult to determine. Nicephorus and Symeon
            Metaphrastes say that <br />Herodias had it buried in the fortress
            of Machaerus, as had been said by Josephus. An Orthodox tradition
            <br />holds that the head relic was taken to the Mount of Olives,
            where it was twice buried and discovered, the <br />latter events
            giving rise to the Orthodox feast of the First and Second Finding of
            the Head of St. John <br />the Baptist. John the Baptist's right
            hand, without the index finger, with which he baptised Jesus, is
            <br />claimed to be in the Serbian Orthodox Cetinje monastery in
            Montenegro. Topkapi Palace, in Istanbul, claims <br />to have John's
            right hand index finger. The saint's left hand is allegedly
            preserved in the Armenian <br />Apostolic Church of St. John at
            Chinsurah, West Bengal, in India, where each year on "Chinsurah Day"
            in <br />January it blesses the Armenian Christians of Calcutta.
