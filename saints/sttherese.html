            St. Therese of Lisieux (2 January 1873-30 September 1897) was a
            French Catholic Discalced Carmelite nun
            <br />who is widely venerated in modern times. She is popularly
            known as "The Little Flower of Jesus," or simply <br />"The Little
            Flower." Therese has been a highly influential model of sanctity for
            Catholics and for others <br />because of the simplicity and
            practicality of her approach to the spiritual life. Together with
            Francis of <br />Assisi, she is one of the most popular saints in
            the history of the Church. Pope Pius X called her "the
            <br />greatest saint of modern times." Therese felt an early call to
            religious life and after overcoming various <br />obstacles in 1888,
            at the early age of 15, she became a nun and joined two of her older
            sisters in the <br />cloistered Carmelite community of Lisieux,
            Normandy. After nine years as a Carmelite religious, having
            <br />fulfilled various offices such as sacristan and assistant to
            the novice mistress, and having spent her last <br />18 months in
            Carmel in a night of faith, she died at the age of 24 from
            tuberculosis.
          </p>
          <h2>Family Background</h2>
          <p>
            Therese was born on Rue Saint-Blaise, in Alencon, France on January
            2, 1873, and was the daughter of
            <br />Marie-Azelie Guerin (usually called Zelie), and Louis Martin
            who was a jeweler and watchmaker. Both her <br />parents were devout
            Catholics who would eventually become the first (and to date only)
            married couple <br />canonized together by the Roman Catholic Church
            (by Pope Francis in 2015). Louis had tried to become a <br />canon
            regular, wanting to enter the Great St Bernard Hospice, but had been
            refused because he didn't know <br />Latin. Zelie, possessed of a
            strong, active temperament, wished to serve the sick, and had also
            considered <br />entering consecrated life, but the prioress of the
            canonesses regular of the Hotel-Dieu in Alencon had
            <br />discouraged her outright. Disappointed, Zelie learned
            lacemaking instead. She excelled in it and set up <br />her own
            business on Rue Saint-Blaise at age 22.
          </p>
          <h2>Birth and infancy</h2>
          <p>
            Soon after her birth in January 1873, the outlook for the survival
            of Therese Martin was uncertain.
            <br />Because of her frail condition, she was entrusted to a wet
            nurse, Rose Taille, who had already nursed <br />two of the Martin
            children. Rose had her own children and could not live with the
            Martins, so Therese <br />was sent to live with her in the forests
            of the Bocage the Semalle. On 2 April 1874, when she was 15
            <br />months old, she returned to Alencon where her family
            surrounded her with affection. "I hear the baby <br />calling me
            Mama! as she goes down the stairs. On every step, she calls out
            Mama! and if I don't respond <br />every time, she remains there
            without going either forward or back." (Madame Martin to Pauline, 21
            November <br />1875) She was educated in a very Catholic
            environment, including Mass attendance at 5:30 a.m., the strict
            <br />observance of fasts, and prayer to the rhythm of the
            liturgical year. The Martins also practiced charity, <br />visiting
            the sick and elderly and welcoming the occasional vagabond to their
            table. Even if she was not <br />the model little girl, her sisters
            later portrayed, Therese was very responsive to this education.
          </p>
          <h2>Early years</h2>
          <p>
            Therese was taught at home until she was eight and a half, and then
            entered the school kept by the
            <br />Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux.
            Therese, taught well and carefully by <br />Marie and Pauline, found
            herself at the top of the class, except for writing and arithmetic.
            However, <br />because of her young age and high grades, she was
            bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl <br />of
            fourteen who did poorly at school. Therese suffered very much as a
            result of her sensitivity, and <br />she cried in silence.
            Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her
            taste. She preferred <br />to tell stories or look after the little
            ones in the infants class.
          </p>
          <h2>Illness</h2>
          <p>
            At this time, Therese was often sick. She began to suffer from
            nervous tremors. The tremors started one
            <br />night after her uncle took her for a walk and began to talk
            about Zelie. Assuming that she was cold, the <br />family covered
            Therese with blankets, but the tremors continued. She clenched her
            teeth and could not speak. <br />The family called Dr. Notta, who
            could make no diagnosis. In 1882, Dr. Gayral diagnosed that Therese
            "reacts <br />to an emotional frustration with a neurotic attack".
            Alarmed, but cloistered, Pauline began to write letters <br />to
            Therese and attempted various strategies to intervene. Eventually
            Therese recovered after she had turned <br />to gaze at the statue
            of the Virgin Mary placed in Marie's room, where Therese had been
            moved. She reported <br />on 13 May 1883 that she had seen the
            Virgin smile at her. She wrote: "Our Blessed Lady has come to me,
            she <br />has smiled upon me. How happy I am."
          </p>
          <h2>Rome and entry to Carmel</h2>
          <p>
            In May 1887, Therese approached her 63-year-old father Louis, who
            was recovering from a small stroke,
            <br />while he sat in the garden one Sunday afternoon and told him
            that she wanted to celebrate the anniversary <br />of "her
            conversion" by entering Carmel before Christmas. Louis and Thérèse
            both broke down and cried, but <br />Louis got up, gently picked a
            little white flower, root intact, and gave it to her, explaining the
            care <br />with which God brought it into being and preserved it
            until that day. Thérèse later wrote: "while I listened <br />I
            believed I was hearing my own story". To Therese, the flower seemed
            a symbol of herself, "destined to live <br />in another soil".
            Therese renewed her attempts to join the Carmel, but the
            priest-superior of the monastery <br />would not allow it on account
            of her youth.
          </p>
          <h2>Final years</h2>
          <p>
            Therese's final years were marked by a steady decline that she bore
            resolutely and without complaint.
            <br />Tuberculosis was the key element of Therese's final suffering,
            but she saw that as part of her spiritual <br />journey. After
            observing a rigorous Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve
            of Good Friday and <br />felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: "Oh!
            how sweet this memory really is! … I had scarcely laid my head
            <br />upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream
            mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it <br />was." The next
            morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her
            fate. Coughing up of <br />blood meant tuberculosis, and
            tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, "I thought immediately of the
            joyful <br />thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the
            window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! <br />my soul
            was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that
            Jesus, on the anniversary <br />of His own death, wanted to have me
            hear His first call!"
