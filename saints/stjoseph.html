            St. Joseph (100 BCE-1 AD) is a figure in the Canonical Gospels who
            was married to Mary, Jesus' mother,
            <br />and was Jesus' legal father. The Gospels name brothers of
            Jesus, but the Gospel of James, an apocryphal <br />work of the late
            2nd century, explained that they were the sons of Joseph from an
            earlier marriage. This <br />position is still held in Orthodox
            Churches, but in the Western Church it was dropped in favour of St.
            <br />Jerome's argument that Joseph, like Mary, must have been a
            lifelong virgin and that the "brothers" must <br />have been his
            cousins. Perspectives on Joseph as a historical figure are
            distinguished from a theological <br />reading of the Gospel texts.
          </p>
          <h2>In the New Testament</h2>
          <p>
            The epistles of Paul are the oldest extant Christian writings. These
            mention Jesus' mother (without
            <br />naming her), but do not refer to his father. The Gospel of
            Mark, believed to be the first gospel to <br />be written and with a
            date about two decades after Paul, also does not mention Jesus'
            father. The <br />first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of
            Matthew and Luke, often dated from around 80-90 AD. <br />Each
            contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from King David, but
            through different sons; Matthew <br />follows the major royal line
            from Solomon, while Luke traces another line back to Nathan, another
            son <br />of David and Bathsheba. Consequently, all the names
            between David and Joseph are different. Like the <br />two differing
            genealogies, the infancy narratives appear only in Matthew and Luke
            and take different <br />approaches to reconciling the requirement
            that the Messiah be born in Bethlehem with the tradition that
            <br />Jesus in fact came from Nazareth.
          </p>
          <h2>Birth of Jesus</h2>
          <p>
            According to the author of the gospel according to Luke, a decree of
            the Roman Emperor Augustus required
            <br />that Joseph return to his hometown of Bethlehem to register
            for a Roman census; see Census of Quirinius. <br />While he was
            there with Mary, she gave birth to Jesus; but because there was no
            place for them in the inn, <br />she used a manger as a cradle.
            After eight days, he was circumcised according to Jewish law and
            named "Jesus <br />(Yeshu'a), which means "Yahweh is salvation".
            After Mary continued in the "blood of her purifying" another
            <br />33 days, for a total of 40 days, she brought her burnt
            offering and sin offering to the Temple in Jerusalem <br />[Luke
            2:22] so the priest could make atonement for her.[Leviticus 12:1-8]
            They also presented Jesus - "As it <br />is written in the law of
            the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to
            the Lord" (Luke <br />2:23 other verses). After the prophecies of
            Simeon and the prophetess Anna in Luke 2:25-38, the family "returned
            <br />into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth".
          </p>
          <h2>Death</h2>
          <p>
            The New Testament has no mention of Joseph's death, but he is never
            mentioned after Jesus's childhood,
            <br />and Mary is always presented as by herself, often dressed as a
            widow, in other texts and art covering <br />the period of the
            ministry and passion of Jesus. By contrast, the apocryphal History
            of Joseph the <br />Carpenter, from the 5th or 6th century, has a
            long account of Joseph's peaceful death, at the age of <br />111, in
            the presence of Jesus (aged about 19), Mary and angels. This scene
            starts to appear in art in <br />the 17th century.
          </p>
          <h2>Later apocryphal writings</h2>
          <p>
            The canonical gospels created a problem: they stated clearly that
            Mary was a virgin when she conceived
            <br />Jesus, and that Joseph was not his father; yet Joseph's
            paternity was essential to establish Jesus' <br />Davidic descent.
            The theological situation was complicated by the gospel references
            to Jesus' "brothers <br />and sisters" (repeated in Paul, where
            James is called the "brother of the Lord"), and by the fact that
            <br />Jesus was described unambiguously by John and Matthew as
            "Joseph's son" and "the carpenter's son". From <br />the 2nd century
            to the 5th writers tried to explain how Jesus could be
            simultaneously the "son of God" <br />and the "son of Joseph".
