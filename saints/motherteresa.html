            Mother Teresa (26 August 1910-5 September 1997) was an Albanian
            Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary.
            <br />She was born in Skopje (now the capital of North Macedonia),
            then part of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman <br />Empire. After
            living in Skopje for eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then
            to India, where she lived <br />for most of her life. In 1950,
            Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic
            religious congregation <br />that had over 4,500 nuns and was active
            in 133 countries in 2012. The congregation manages homes for people
            <br />who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis. It also
            runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, <br />children's
            and family counselling programmes and orphanages and schools.
            Members take vows of chastity, poverty <br />and obedience and also
            profess a fourth vow: to give wholehearted free service to the
            poorest of the poor.

          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <p>
            Teresa was born Anjeze Gonxhe (or Gonxha) Bojaxhiu Anjeze is a
            cognate of "Agnes"; Gonxhe means "rosebud"
            <br />or "little flower" in Albanian) on 26 August 1910 into a
            Kosovar Albanian family in Skopje, Ottoman Empire <br />(now the
            capital of North Macedonia). She was baptised in Skopje, the day
            after her birth. She later considered <br />27 August, the day she
            was baptised, her "true birthday". She was the youngest child of
            Nikolle and Dranafile <br />Bojaxhiu (Bernai). Her father, who was
            involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died
            <br />in 1919 when she was eight years old. He was born in Prizren
            (today in Kosovo), however, his family was from <br />Mirdita
            (present-day Albania). Her mother may have been from a village near
            Gjakova. According to a biography <br />by Joan Graff Clucas, Teresa
            was in her early years when she was fascinated by stories of the
            lives of missionaries <br />and their service in Bengal; by age 12,
            she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life.
            <br />Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she prayed at
            the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, <br />where she
            often went on pilgrimages.

          <h2>Missionaries of Charity</h2>
          <p>
            On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as
            "the call within the call" when she
            <br />travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from
            Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to <br />leave the convent
            and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail
            would have been to <br />break the faith." Joseph Langford later
            wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just
            <br />become Mother Teresa". She began missionary work with the poor
            in 1948, replacing her traditional Loreto <br />habit with a simple,
            white cotton sari with a blue border. Teresa adopted Indian
            citizenship, spent several <br />months in Patna to receive basic
            medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the
            slums. She <br />founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she
            began tending to the poor and hungry. At the beginning of <br />1949
            Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she
            laid the foundation for a new religious <br />community helping the
            "poorest among the poor".
          </p>
          <h2>International charity</h2>
          <p>
            Teresa said, "By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By
            faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my
            <br />calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong
            entirely to the Heart of Jesus." Fluent in five <br />languages -
            Bengali, Albanian, Serbian, English and Hindi - she made occasional
            trips outside India for <br />humanitarian reasons. At the height of
            the Siege of Beirut in 1982, Teresa rescued 37 children trapped in
            <br />a front-line hospital by brokering a temporary cease-fire
            between the Israeli army and Palestinian guerrillas.
            <br />Accompanied by Red Cross workers, she travelled through the
            war zone to the hospital to evacuate the young <br />patients. When
            Eastern Europe experienced increased openness in the late 1980s,
            Teresa expanded her efforts <br />to Communist countries which had
            rejected the Missionaries of Charity. She began dozens of projects,
            undeterred <br />by criticism of her stands against abortion and
            divorce: "No matter who says what, you should accept it with a
            <br />smile and do your own work." She visited Armenia after the
            1988 earthquake and met with Soviet Premier <br />Nikolai Ryzhkov.
          </p>
          <h2>Declining health and death</h2>
          <p>
            Teresa had a heart attack in Rome in 1983 while she was visiting
            Pope John Paul II. Following a second
            <br />attack in 1989, she received an pacemaker. In 1991, after a
            bout of pneumonia in Mexico, she had additional <br />heart
            problems. Although Teresa offered to resign as head of the
            Missionaries of Charity, in a secret <br />ballot the sisters of the
            congregation voted for her to stay and she agreed to continue. On 13
            March 1997, <br />Teresa resigned as head of the Missionaries of
            Charity, and she died on 5 September, as news was already
            <br />overshadowed on the death of Princess Diana a few days
            earlier. At the time of her death, the Missionaries <br />of Charity
            had over 4,000 sisters and an associated brotherhood of 300 members
            operating 610 missions in 123 <br />countries. These included
            hospices and homes for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy and
            tuberculosis, soup kitchens, <br />children's-and family-counselling
            programmes, orphanages and schools. The Missionaries of Charity were
            aided <br />by co-workers numbering over one million by the 1990s.
