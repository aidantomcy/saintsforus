            <br />St. Peter (AD 1-AD 68), also known as Simon Peter, was one of
            the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ <br />and one of the first
            leaders of the Early Church. According to Christian tradition, Peter
            was crucified <br />in Rome under Emperor Nero. He is traditionally
            counted as the first Bishop of Rome or Pope and also <br />as the
            first Patriarch of Antioch by the Eastern Christian tradition. The
            ancient Christian churches all venerate <br />Peter as a major saint
            and as the founder of the Church of Antioch and the Diocese of Rome,
            but differ in <br />their attitudes regarding the authority of his
            successors. According to Catholic teaching, in Matthew 16:18,
            <br />Jesus promised Peter a special position in the church.
          </p>
          <h2>Names and Etymologies</h2>
          <p>
            The New Testament presents Peter's original name as Simon. In only
            two passages, his name is instead spelled
            <br />"Simeon". The variation possibly reflects "the well-known
            custom among Jews at the time of giving the name of <br />a famous
            patriarch or personage of the Old Testament to a male child [i.e.,
            Simeon] along with a similar sounding <br />Greek/Roman name [in
            this case, Simon]". He was later given by Jesus the name Cephas,
            from Aramaic (Kepha), literally <br />meaning "rock" or "stone". In
            translations of the Bible from the original Greek, his name is
            maintained as Cephas <br />n 9 occurrences in the New Testament,
            whereas in the vast majority of mentions (156 occurrences in the New
            Testament) <br />he is called (Petros), from the Greek and Latin
            word for a rock or stone (petra) to which the masculine ending was
            <br />added, rendered into English as Peter.
          </p>
          <h2>First leader of the early Church</h2>
          <p>
            The Gospels and Acts portray Peter as the most prominent apostle,
            though he denied Jesus three times during
            <br />the events of the crucifixion. According to the Christian
            tradition, Peter was the first disciple to whom <br />Jesus
            appeared, balancing Peter's denial and restoring his position. Peter
            is regarded as the first leader <br />of the early Church, though he
            was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, "the Brother
            of the <br />Lord". Because Peter was the first to whom Jesus
            appeared, the leadership of Peter forms the basis of the
            <br />Apostolic succession and the institutional power of orthodoxy,
            as the heirs of Peter, and he is described <br />as "the rock" on
            which the church will be built. Peter is always listed first among
            the Twelve Apostles in <br />the gospels and in the Book of Acts. He
            is also frequently mentioned in the gospels as forming with James
            the <br />Elder and John a special group within the Twelve Apostles,
            present at incidents at which the others were not <br />present,
            such as at the Transfiguration of Jesus, at the raising of Jairus'
            daughter and at the agony in the <br />Garden of Gethsemane. Peter
            often confesses his faith in Jesus as the Messiah.
          </p>
          <h2>Connection to Rome</h2>
          <p>
            In a tradition of the early Church, Peter is said to have founded
            the Church in Rome with Paul, served as
            <br />its bishop, authored two epistles, and then met martyrdom
            there along with Paul. The Catholic Church speaks <br />of the pope,
            the bishop of Rome, as the successor of Saint Peter. This is often
            interpreted to imply that <br />Peter was the first Bishop of Rome.
            However, it is also said that the institution of the papacy is not
            <br />dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on
            his ever having been in Rome. St. Clement of <br />Rome identifies
            Peter and Paul as the outstanding heroes of the faith.There is no
            obvious biblical evidence <br />that Peter was ever in Rome, but the
            first epistle of Peter does mention that "The church that is at
            Babylon, <br />elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth
            Marcus my son."
          </p>
          <h2>Death and Burial</h2>
          <p>
            In the epilogue of the Gospel of John, Jesus hints at the death by
            which Peter would glorify God, saying: "when
            <br />you are old you will stretch out your hands, and another will
            dress you and carry you where you do not want to <br />go." This is
            interpreted by some as a reference to Peter's crucifixion.
            Theologians Donald Fay Robinson and Warren <br />M. Smaltz have
            suggested that the incident in Acts 12:1-17, where Peter is
            "released by an angel" and goes to "another <br />place", really
            represents an idealized account of his death, which may have
            occurred in a Jerusalem prison as early <br />as AD 44.Early Church
            tradition says that Peter probably died by crucifixion (with arms
            outstretched) at the time <br />of the Great Fire of Rome in the
            year 64. This took place three months after the disastrous fire that
            destroyed <br />Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame
            the Christians. In the early 4th century, the Emperor Constantine
            <br />decided to honour Peter with a large basilica.[100][101]
            Because the precise location of Peter's burial was so firmly
            <br />fixed in the belief of the Christians of Rome, the church to
            house the basilica had to be erected on a site that was <br />not
            convenient to construction.
          </p>
          <h2>Catholic Church</h2>
          <p>
            According to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus
            to hold the first place of honor and
            <br />authority. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first
            Bishop of Rome, the first Pope. Furthermore, <br />they consider
            every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all
            other bishops. However, <br />Peter never bore the title of "Pope"
            or "Vicar of Christ" in the sense the Catholic Church considers
            Peter <br />the first Pope. The Catholic Church's recognition of
            Peter as head of its church on earth (with Christ being <br />its
            heavenly head) is based on its interpretation of two passages from
            the canonical gospels of the New <br />Testament, as well as sacred
            tradition.
