            St. John Paul II (18 May 1920-2 April 2005) was the head of the
            Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican
            <br />City state from 1978 until his death in 2005. He was elected
            Pope by the second papal conclave of 1978, which <br />was called
            after Pope John Paul I, who had been elected in August to succeed
            Pope Paul VI, died after 33 days <br />of being named the Pope.
            Cardinal Wojtyla was elected on the third day of the conclave and
            adopted the name of <br />his predecessor in tribute to him. John
            Paul II is recognized as helping to end Communist rule in his native
            <br />Poland and the rest of Europe. He significantly improved the
            Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam <br />and the
            Eastern Orthodox Church. Born in Poland, John Paul II was the first
            non-Italian pope since Adrian VI <br />in the 16th century and the
            second-longest-serving pope in modern history.
          </p>
          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <p>
            Karol Jozef Wojtyla was born in the Polish town of Wadowice. He was
            the youngest of three children born
            <br />to Karol Wojtyla (1879-1941), an ethnic Pole, and Emilia
            Kaczorowska (1884-1929), who was of distant <br />Lithuanian
            heritage. Emilia, who was a schoolteacher, died from a heart attack
            and kidney failure in 1929 <br />when Wojtyla was eight years old.
            His elder sister Olga had died before his birth, but he was close to
            his <br />brother Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his
            senior. Edmund's work as a physician eventually led <br />to his
            death from scarlet fever, a loss that affected Wojtyla deeply.
            Wojtyla was baptized a month after his <br />birth, made his First
            Communion at the age of 9, and was confirmed at the age of 18. As a
            boy, Wojtyla was <br />athletic, often playing football as
            goalkeeper. During his childhood, Wojtyla had contact with the large
            Jewish <br />community of Wadowice. School football games were often
            organised between teams of Jews and Catholics, and <br />Wojtyla
            often played on the Jewish side. "I remember that at least a third
            of my classmates at elementary school <br />in Wadowice were Jews.
            At elementary school there were fewer. With some I was on very
            friendly terms. And what <br />struck me about some of them was
            their Polish patriotism."
          </p>
          <h2>Priesthood</h2>
          <p>
            After finishing his studies at the seminary in Krakow, Wojtyla was
            ordained as a priest on All Saints' Day,
            <br />1 November 1946, by the Archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Adam
            Stefan Sapieha. Sapieha sent Wojtyla to Rome's <br />Pontifical
            International Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University
            of Saint Thomas Aquinas, to <br />study under the French Dominican
            friar Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange beginning on 26 November 1946. He
            resided <br />in the Belgian Pontifical College during this time,
            under rectorship of Maximilien de Furstenberg. Wojtyla <br />earned
            a licence in July 1947, passed his doctoral exam on 14 June 1948,
            and successfully defended his doctoral <br />thesis titled Doctrina
            de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce (The Doctrine of Faith in St. John
            of the Cross) in <br />philosophy on 19 June 1948. The Angelicum
            preserves the original copy of Wojtyla's typewritten thesis. Among
            <br />other courses at the Angelicum, Wojtyla studied Hebrew with
            the Dutch Dominican Peter G. Duncker, author of <br />the
            <em>Compendium grammaticae linguae hebraicae biblicae.</em>
          </p>
          <h2>Pastoral Journeys</h2>
          <p>
            During his pontificate, John Paul II made journeys to 129 countries,
            travelling more than 1,100,000
            <br />kilometres (680,000 mi) while doing so. He consistently
            attracted large crowds, some among the largest <br />ever assembled
            in human history, such as the Manila World Youth Day, which gathered
            up to four million <br />people, the largest papal gathering ever,
            according to the Vatican. John Paul II's earliest official
            <br />visits were to the Dominican Republic and Mexico in January
            1979. While some of his journeys (such as <br />to the United States
            and the Holy Land) were to places previously visited by Pope Paul
            VI, John Paul <br />II became the first pope to visit the White
            House in October 1979, where he was greeted warmly by
            <br />then-President Jimmy Carter. He was the first pope ever to
            visit several countries in one year, starting <br />in 1979 with
            Mexico and Ireland. He was the first reigning pope to travel to the
            United Kingdom, in 1982, <br />where he met Queen Elizabeth II, the
            Supreme Governor of the Church of England. While in Britain he also
            <br />visited Canterbury Cathedral and knelt in prayer with Robert
            Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the <br />spot where Thomas
            a Becket had been killed, as well as holding several large-scale
            open air masses, including <br />one at Wembley Stadium, which was
            attended by some 80,000 people.
          </p>
          <h2>Assassination attempts and plots</h2>
          <p>
            As he entered St. Peter's Square to address an audience on 13 May
            1981, John Paul II was shot and
            <br />critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Agca, an expert Turkish
            gunman who was a member of the militant <br />fascist group Grey
            Wolves. The assassin used a Browning 9 mm semi-automatic pistol,
            shooting the <br />pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and
            small intestine multiple times John Paul II was <br />rushed into
            the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to
            the hospital, he <br />lost consciousness. Even though the two
            bullets missed his mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, <br />he
            lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of
            surgery to treat his wounds. <br />Surgeons performed a colostomy,
            temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let
            <br />the damaged lower part heal. When he briefly regained
            consciousness before being operated on, he <br />instructed the
            doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation. One
            of the few people <br />allowed in to see him at the Gemelli Clinic
            was one of his closest friends philosopher Anna-Teresa
            <br />Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him
            company while he recovered from emergency <br />surgery. The pope
            later stated that the Blessed Virgin Mary helped keep him alive
            throughout his <br />ordeal.
          </p>
          <h2>Death and funeral</h2>
          <p>
            John Paul II was hospitalised with breathing problems caused by a
            bout of influenza on 1 February
            <br />2005. He left the hospital on 10 February, but was
            subsequently hospitalised again with breathing <br />problems two
            weeks later and underwent a tracheotomy. On 31 March 2005, following
            a urinary tract <br />infection, he developed septic shock, a form
            of infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, <br />but was
            not hospitalised. Instead, he was monitored by a team of consultants
            at his private residence. <br />This was taken as an indication by
            the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it
            <br />would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the
            Vatican. Later that day, Vatican sources <br />announced that John
            Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and
            secretary <br />Stanislaw Dziwisz. Upon hearing of this, the dying
            pope was said to have stated: "I have searched for <br />you, and
            now you have come to me, and I thank you." On Saturday, 2 April
            2005, at approximately 15:30 <br />CEST, John Paul II spoke his
            final words in Polish,
            <em>"Pozwolcie mi odejsc do domu Ojca"</em> ("Allow me to
            <br />depart to the house of the Father"), to his aides, and fell
            into a coma about four hours later.
