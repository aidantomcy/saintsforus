            St. Anthony of Padua (15 August 1195-13 June 1231), also known as
            Anthony of Lisbon, was a <br />Portuguese Catholic Priest and Friar
            of the Franciscan Order. He was born and raised by a <br />wealthy
            family in Lisbon, Portugal, and died in Padua, Italy. Noted by his
            contempararies for <br />his powerful preaching, expert knowledge of
            scripture and undying love and devotion to the <br />
            poor and the sick, he was one of the most quickly canonized saints
            in church history. He was <br />
            proclaimed a Doctor of the Church on 16 January 1946. He is also the
            patron saint of lost things.

          <h2>Early years</h2>
          <p>
            Fernando Martins de Bulhoes was born in Lisbon, Portugal. While
            15th-century writers state that his
            <br />parents were Vicente Martins and Teresa Pais Taveira, and that
            his father was the brother of Pedro <br />Martins de Bulhoes, the
            ancestor of the Bulhão or Bulhoes family, Niccolo Dal-Gal views this
            as less <br />certain. His wealthy and noble family arranged for him
            to be instructed at the local cathedral school. <br />At the age of
            15, he entered the Augustinian community of Canons Regular of the
            Order of the Holy Cross <br />at the Abbey of Saint Vincent on the
            outskirts of Lisbon. In 1212, distracted by frequent visits from
            <br />family and friends, he asked to be transferred to the
            motherhouse of the congregation, the Monastery <br />of the Holy
            Cross in Coimbra, then the capital of Portugal. There, the young
            Fernando studied theology <br />and Latin.
          </p>

          <h2>Joining the Franciscans</h2>
          <p>
            After his ordination to the priesthood, Fernando was named
            guestmaster at the age of 19, and placed in
            <br />charge of hospitality for the abbey. While he was in Coimbra,
            some Franciscan friars arrived and settled <br />at a small
            hermitage outside Coimbra dedicated to Anthony of Egypt. Fernando
            was strongly attracted to
            <br />
            the simple, evangelical lifestyle of the friars, whose order had
            been founded only 11 years prior. News <br />
            arrived that five Franciscans had been beheaded in Morocco, the
            first of their order to be killed. King
            <br />
            Afonso II ransomed their bodies to be returned and buried as martyrs
            in the Abbey of Santa Cruz. Inspired
            <br />
            by their example, Fernando obtained permission from church
            authorities to leave the Canons Regular to join
            <br />
            the new Franciscan order. Upon his admission to the life of the
            friars, he joined the small hermitage in <br />
            Olivais, adopting the name Anthony (from the name of the chapel
            located there, dedicated to Anthony the Great),
            <br />
            by which he was to be known.
          </p>
          <h2>Preaching and teaching</h2>
          <p>
            In 1222, in the town of Forli, a number of visiting Dominican friars
            were present for the occasion <br />of an ordination, and a
            misunderstanding arose over who should preach. The Franciscans had
            expected <br />that one of the Dominicans would occupy the pulpit,
            being renowned for their preaching. However, the <br />Dominicans
            had come unprepared, thinking a Franciscan would be the homilist. In
            this quandary, the head <br />of the hermitage, who did not think
            any of his own humble friars could give a homily for the occasion,
            <br />called upon Anthony, whom he suspected was most qualified, and
            entreated him to speak whatever the Holy <br />Spirit might inspire.
            Anthony objected, but was overruled, and his impromptu sermon
            created a deep <br />impression on his audience.
          </p>
          <h2>Legends</h2>
          <p>
            The story of Anthony "preaching to the fish,“ originated in Rimini,
            where he had gone to preach. When
            <br />heretics there treated him with contempt, Anthony was said to
            have gone to the shoreline, where he began <br />to preach at the
            water's edge until a great crowd of fish was seen gathered before
            him. The people of the <br />town flocked to see this marvel, after
            which Anthony charged them with the fact that the fish were more
            <br />receptive to his message than the heretics of the church, at
            which point the people were moved to listen <br />to his message. In
            another often-told story, which took place in Toulouse, Anthony was
            challenged by a <br />heretic to prove the reality of the presence
            of Christ in the Eucharist. The man, who sought to mock
            <br />Anthony, brought out a half-starved mule and showed it fresh
            fodder on one hand, and the sacramental host <br />on the other. The
            mule was said to have ignored the fodder and, instead of eating
            either, bowed before the <br />sacrament.
          </p>
          <h2>Death</h2>
          <p>
            Anthony became sick with ergotism in 1231, and went to the woodland
            retreat at Camposampiero with <br />two other friars for a respite.
            There, he lived in a room built for him under the branches of a
            walnut <br />tree. Anthony died on the way back to Padua on 13 June
            1231 at the Poor Clare monastery at Arcella <br />(now part of
            Padua), at the age of 35. According to his request, Anthony was
            buried in the small church <br />of Santa Maria Mater Domini
            (probably dating from the late 12th century) and near a convent
            which had <br />been founded by him in 1229. Nevertheless, due to
            his increased notability, construction of a large basilica
            <br />began around 1232, although it was not completed until 1301.
            The smaller church was incorporated into the <br />structure as the
            Cappella della Madonna Mora (Chapel of the Dark Madonna). The
            basilica is commonly known <br />today as "Il Santo" (The Saint).
          </p>
          <h2>Saint and Doctor of the Church</h2>
          <p>
            Anthony was canonized by Pope Gregory IX on 30 May 1232, at Spoleto,
            Italy, less than one year after <br />his death. In the words of
            Pope Benedict XVI: The richness of spiritual teaching contained in
            the Sermons <br />was so great that in [16 January] 1946 Venerable
            Pope Pius XII proclaimed Anthony a Doctor of the Church,
            <br />attributing to him the title Doctor Evangelicus ["Evangelical
            Doctor"], since the freshness and beauty of <br />the Gospel emerge
            from these writings. Anthony's fame spread through Portuguese
            evangelization, and he has <br />been known as the most celebrated
            of the followers of Francis of Assisi. He is the patron saint of
            Lisbon, Padua <br />and many places in Portugal and in the countries
            of the former Portuguese Empire. He is especially invoked and
            <br />venerated all over the world as the patron saint for the
            recovery of lost items and is credited with many <br />miracles
            involving lost people, lost things and even lost spiritual goods.
