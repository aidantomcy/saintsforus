            Carlo Acutis (3 May 1991-12 October 2006) was an English-born
            Italian Catholic youth and amateur <br />
            computer programmer, who is best known for documenting Eucharistic
            Miracles around the world and <br />
            cataloguing them onto a
            <a href="http://www.miracolieucaristici.org/en/liste/list.html"
              >website</a

            that he created before his death from leukemia. He was noted for his
            <br />
            cheerfulness, computer skills and deep devotion to the Eucharist,
            which was a core theme of his life. <br />
            Carlo Acutis was born to a wealthy Italian family with Irish and
            Polish roots. His baptism took place <br />
            on 18 May 1991 at the Church of Our Lady of Dolours, Chelsea. Acutis
            used to attend Mass daily and <br />
            and never forgot to pray to Mother Mary by saying the rosary daily.
            He died at the tender age of 15 <br />
            and was Beatified on 10 October 2020.

          <h2>Life</h2>
          <p>
            Carlo Acutis was born in London on 3 May 1991 to a wealthy Italian
            family. In 1995, when Acutis was four
            <br />years old, his maternal grandfather died and was said to have
            appeared to him in a dream asking to be prayed <br />for. When the
            child evinced a precocious interest in religious practice, his
            questions were answered by the <br />family's Polish baby-sitter.
            Three years later he requested to receive his First Communion at the
            age of seven. <br />After consulting a prelate and providing
            instruction, the family arranged this at the convent of
            Sant'Ambrogio <br />ad Nemus. After that he made the effort, either
            before or after Mass, to reflect before the tabernacle. Acutis
            <br />became a frequent communicant and would make a weekly
            confession. He is said to have had several models as guides
            <br />for his life, especially Francis of Assisi, as well as
            Francisco and Jacinta Marto, Dominic Savio, Tarcisius, <br />and
            Bernadette Soubirous.
          </p>
          <h2>Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            Acutis's mother, Antonia, is said to attribute to his intercession
            the fact that, at the age of 44, she
            <br />gave birth to twins, born exactly four years to the day after
            his death. Following the Catholic Church's <br />recognition of a
            miracle in 2020, attributed to Acutis, Antonia told the press that
            her son had appeared <br />to her in dreams saying that he will not
            only be beatified but also canonised a saint in the future. In
            <br />memory of Acutis, bishops Raffaello Martinelli and Angelo
            Comastri have helped to organize a travelling <br />photo exhibition
            of all the Eucharistic miracle sites. It has since travelled to
            dozens of different <br />countries across five continents. On 15th
            December 2020, under the provisions of Canon Law, Archbishop
            <br />Bernard established a new parish in the Archdiocese of
            Birmingham under the patronage of the Blessed <br />Carlo Acutis.
            The parish incorporates the three churches of St Peter & Paul, St
            Michael and St Bernadette <br />in Wolverhampton.

          <h2>Beatification</h2>
          <p>
            The call for him to be beatified began not long after Acutis's
            death. The campaign gained momentum in 2013
            <br />after he was named a Servant of God, the first stage on the
            path towards sainthood. The Lombardy Episcopal <br />Conference
            approved the petition for the official canonization cause to proceed
            at a meeting in 2013. The <br />opening of the diocesan
            investigation was held on 15 February 2013, with Cardinal Angelo
            Scola inaugurating <br />the process, and concluding it on 24
            November 2016. The formal introduction to the cause took place on 13
            <br />May 2013, and Acutis became titled a "Servant of God". Pope
            Francis next confirmed his life as one of heroic <br />virtue on 5
            July 2018, and declared him Venerable.
