            St. Aidan of Lindisfarne (Around 590-31 August 651) was an Irish
            monk and missionary credited with
            <br />converting the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in Northumbria. He
            founded a monastic cathedral on the <br />island of Lindisfarne,
            known as Lindisfarne Priory, served as its first bishop, and
            travelled ceaselessly <br />throughout the countryside, spreading
            the gospel to both the Anglo-Saxon nobility and the <br />socially
            disenfranchised (including children and slaves). He is known as the
            Apostle of Northumbria and <br />is recognised as a saint by the
            Eastern Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion
            <br />and others.
          </p>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            St. Aidan, the Apostle of Northumbria, was the founder and first
            bishop of the Lindisfarne island monastery
            <br />in England. He is credited with restoring Christianity to
            Northumbria. Aidan is the Anglicised form of the <br />original Old
            Irish Aedan, Modern Irish Aodhán (meaning "little fiery one").
            Possibly born in Connacht, Aidan <br />was originally a monk at the
            monastery on the Island of Iona, founded by St Columba. In the years
            prior to <br />Aidan's mission, Christianity, which had been
            propagated throughout Britain but not Ireland by the Roman Empire,
            <br />was being largely displaced by Anglo-Saxon paganism. In the
            monastery of Iona (founded by Columba of the Irish Church),
            <br />the religion soon found one of its principal exponents in
            Oswald of Northumbria, a noble youth who had been <br />raised there
            as a king in exile since 616.
          </p>

          <h2>Missionary efforts</h2>
          <p>
            Allying himself with the pious king, Aidan chose the island of
            Lindisfarne, which was close to the royal
            <br />castle at Bamburgh, as the seat of his diocese An inspired
            missionary, Aidan would walk from one village <br />to another,
            politely conversing with the people he saw and slowly interesting
            them in Christianity: in <br />this, he followed the early apostolic
            model of conversion, by offering "them first the milk of gentle
            <br />doctrine, to bring them by degrees, while nourishing them with
            the Divine Word, to the true understanding <br />and practice of the
            more advanced precepts." By patiently talking to the people on their
            own level (and by <br />taking an active interest in their lives and
            communities), Aidan and his monks slowly restored Christianity
            <br />to the Northumbrian countryside. King Oswald, who after his
            years of exile had a perfect command of Gaelic, <br />often had to
            translate for Aidan and his monks, who did not speak English at
            first.
          </p>
          <h2>Death</h2>
          <p>
            When Oswald died in 642, Aidan received continued support from King
            Oswine of Deira and the two became
            <br />close friends. As such, the monk's ministry continued
            relatively unchanged until the rise of pagan <br />hostilities in
            651. At that time, a pagan army attacked Bamburgh and attempted to
            set its walls ablaze. <br />According to legend, Aidan saw the black
            smoke from his cell at Lindisfarne Abbey, immediately recognized
            <br />its cause, and knelt in prayer for the fate of the city.
            Miraculously, the winds abruptly reversed their <br />course,
            blowing the conflagration towards the enemy, which convinced them
            that the capital city was defended <br />by potent spiritual forces.
            Around this time, Oswine was betrayed and murdered. Two weeks later
            Aidan died, <br />on 31 August 651.
          </p>
          <h2>Legacy and veneration</h2>
          <p>
            After his death, Aidan's body was buried at Lindisfarne, beneath the
            abbey that he had helped found.
            <br />Though his popularity waned in the coming years, "in the 11th
            century Glastonbury monks obtained some <br />supposed relics of
            Aidan; through their influence Aidan's feast appears in the early
            Wessex calendars, <br />which provide the main evidence for his cult
            after the age of Bede." His feast is celebrated on the
            <br />anniversary of his death, 31 August. Reflecting his Irish
            origins, his Scottish monasticism and his <br />ministry to the
            English, Aidan has been proposed as a possible patron saint for the
            whole of the <br />United Kingdom.
