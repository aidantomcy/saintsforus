            St. Francis Xavier (7 April 1506-3 December 1552) was a Spanish
            Catholic priest, missionary <br />and saint from Navarre; he was the
            co-founder of the Society of Jesus. Born in Javier, Kingdom of
            <br />Navarre, he was a companion of Ignatius of Loyola and one of
            the first seven Jesuits who took vows <br />of poverty and chastity
            at Montmartre, Paris, in 1534. He led an extensive mission into
            Asia, mainly <br />in the Portuguese Empire of the time, and was
            influential in evangalization work, most notably in India. <br />He
            was beatified by Pope Paul V on 25 October 1619 and canonized by
            Pope Gregory XV on 12 March 1622.
          </p>
          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Francis Xavier was born in the royal castle of Xavier, in the
            Kingdom of Navarre, on 7 April 1506
            <br />according to a family register. He was the youngest son of
            Juan de Jasso y Atondo, seneschal of <br />Xavier castle, who
            belonged to a prosperous farming family and had acquired a doctorate
            in law at <br />the University of Bologna. Basque was his mother
            tongue. Juan later became a privy counsellor <br />and finance
            minister to King John III of Navarre (Jean d'Albret). Francis's
            mother was Dona <br />Maria de Azpilcueta y Aznarez, sole heiress of
            two noble Navarrese families. He was through her <br />related to
            the great theologian and philosopher Martin de Azpilcueta. In 1512,
            Ferdinand, King of <br />Aragon and regent of Castile, invaded
            Navarre, initiating a war that lasted over 18 years. Three
            <br />years later, Francis's father died when Francis was only nine
            years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers <br />participated in a
            failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from
            the kingdom.
          </p>
          <h2>Missionary work</h2>
          <p>
            On 15 August 1534, seven students met in a crypt beneath the Church
            of Saint Denis (now Saint Pierre de
            <br />Montmartre), on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking Paris.
            They were Francis, Ignatius of Loyola, Alfonso <br />Salmeron, Diego
            Lainez, Nicolas Bobadilla from Spain, Peter Faber from Savoy, and
            Simao Rodrigues from <br />Portugal. They made private vows of
            poverty, chastity, and obedience to the Pope, and also vowed to go
            to <br />the Holy Land to convert infidels. Francis began his study
            of theology in 1534 and was ordained <br />on 24 June 1537. In 1539,
            after long discussions, Ignatius drew up a formula for a new
            religious order, <br />the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits).
            Ignatius's plan for the order was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540.
          </p>
          <h2>Burials and Relics</h2>
          <p>
            Xavier was first buried on a beach at Shangchuan Island, Taishan,
            Guangdong. His body was taken from the
            <br />
            island in February 1553 and temporarily buried in St. Paul's Church
            in Portuguese Malacca on 22 March 1553. <br />
            An open grave in the church now marks the place of Xavier's burial.
            Pereira came back from Goa, removed the <br />
            corpse shortly after 15 April 1553, and moved it to his house. On 11
            December 1553, Xavier's body was shipped <br />
            to Goa. The body is now in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Goa, where
            it was placed in a glass container encased <br />
            in a silver casket on 2 December 1637. This casket, constructed by
            Goan silversmiths between 1636 and 1637, <br />
            was an exemplary blend of Italian and Indian aesthetic
            sensibilities. There are 32 silver plates on all four sides <br />
            of the casket, depicting different episodes from the life of Xavier.
          </p>
          <h2>Veneration</h2>
          <p>
            Francis Xavier was beatified by Paul V on 25 October 1619, and was
            canonized by Gregory XV on 12 March
            <br />1622, at the same time as Ignatius Loyola. Pius XI proclaimed
            him the "Patron of Catholic Missions". <br />His feast day is 3
            December. Saint Francis Xavier's relics are kept in a silver casket,
            elevated inside <br />the Bom Jesus Basilica and are exposed (being
            brought to ground level) generally every ten years, but <br />this
            is discretionary. The sacred relics went on display starting on 22
            November 2014 at the XVII Solemn <br />Exposition. The display
            closed on 4 January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth,
            was held from <br />21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005. Relics of
            Saint Francis Xavier are also found in the Espirito Santo
            <br />(Holy Spirit) Church, Margao, in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi
            Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier), Batpal, <br />Canacona, Goa,
            and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais, Panjim.
