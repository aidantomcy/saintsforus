            St. Paul (5 AD-67 AD) was an apostle (although not one of the Twelve
            Apostles) who taught the Gospel of
            <br />Christ to the 1st-century world. Paul is generally considered
            one of the most important figures of the <br />Apostolic Age, and
            from the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD, he founded several Christian
            communities in Asia <br />Minor and Europe. According to the New
            Testament book Acts of the Apostles, Paul participated in the
            <br />persecution of the "embryonic Christian Movement" in the area
            of Jerusalem, prior to his conversion. In <br />the narrative of the
            Acts, Paul was travelling on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on
            a mission to <br />"arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem"
            when the ascended Jesus appeared to him in a great bright
            <br />light. He was struck blind, but after three days his sight was
            restored by Ananias of Damascus. Paul then <br />began to preach
            that Jesus of Nazareth is the Jewish Messiah and the Son of God.
            Approximately half of the <br />book of Acts deals with Paul's life
            and works.
          </p>
          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <p>
            The two main sources of information that give access to the earliest
            segments of Paul's career are the
            <br />Book of Acts and the autobiographical elements of Paul's
            letters to the early Christian communities. <br />Paul was likely
            born between the years of 5 BC and 5 AD. The Book of Acts indicates
            that Paul was a Roman <br />citizen by birth, but Helmut Koester
            takes issue with the evidence presented by the text. He was from a
            <br />devout Jewish family based in the city of Tarsus. One of the
            larger centers of trade on the Mediterranean <br />coast and
            renowned for its university, Tarsus had been among the most
            influential cities in Asia Minor <br />since the time of Alexander
            the Great, who died in 323 BC. Paul referred to himself as being "of
            the stock <br />of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the
            Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee". The Bible <br />reveals
            very little about Paul's family. Acts quotes Paul referring to his
            family by saying he was "a Pharisee, <br />born of Pharisees".
            Paul's nephew, his sister's son, is mentioned in Acts 23:16. In
            Romans 16:7, he states <br />that his relatives, Andronicus and
            Junia, were Christians before he was and were prominent among the
            <br />Apostles.
          </p>
          <h2>Persecutor of early Christians</h2>
          <p>
            Paul says that prior to his conversion, he persecuted early
            Christians "beyond measure", more specifically
            <br />Hellenised diaspora Jewish members who had returned to the
            area of Jerusalem. According to James Dunn, the <br />Jerusalem
            community consisted of "Hebrews," Jews speaking both Aramaic and
            Greek, and "Hellenists," Jews <br />speaking only Greek, possibly
            diaspora Jews who had resettled in Jerusalem. Paul's initial
            persecution of <br />Christians probably was directed against these
            Greek-speaking "Hellenists" due to their anti-Temple attitude.
            <br />Within the early Jewish Christian community, this also set
            them apart from the "Hebrews" and their continuing
            <br />participation in the Temple cult.
          </p>
          <h2>Conversion</h2>
          <p>
            Paul's conversion can be dated to 31-36 by his reference to it in
            one of his letters. In Galatians
            <br />1:16, Paul writes that God "was pleased to reveal his son to
            me." In 1 Corinthians 15:8, as he lists <br />the order in which
            Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, Paul writes,
            "last of all, <br />as to one untimely born, He appeared to me
            also." According to the account in the Book of Acts, it <br />took
            place on the road to Damascus, where he reported having experienced
            a vision of the ascended Jesus. <br />The account says that "He fell
            to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why do
            you <br />persecute me?' He asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The reply
            came, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting'." <br />According to
            the account in Act 9:1-22, he was blinded for three days and had to
            be led into Damascus <br />by the hand. During these three days,
            Saul took no food or water and spent his time in prayer to God.
            <br />When Ananias of Damascus arrived, he laid his hands on him and
            said: "Brother Saul, the Lord, [even] <br />Jesus, that appeared
            unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou
            mightest receive thy <br />sight, and be filled with the Holy
            Ghost." His sight was restored, he got up and was baptized. This
            story <br />occurs only in Acts, not in the Pauline epistles.
          </p>
          <h2>Death</h2>
          <p>
            The date of Paul's death is believed to have occurred after the
            Great Fire of Rome in July 64, but before
            <br />the last year of Nero's reign, in 68. The Second Epistle to
            Timothy states that Paul was arrested in Troad <br />and brought
            back to Rome, where he was imprisoned and put on trial; the Epistle
            was traditionally ascribed <br />to Paul, but today many scholars
            considered it to be pseudepigrapha, perhaps written by one of Paul's
            disciples. <br />Pope Clement I writes in his Epistle to the
            Corinthians that after Paul "had borne his testimony before the
            <br />rulers", he "departed from the world and went unto the holy
            place, having been found a notable pattern of <br />patient
            endurance." Ignatius of Antioch writes in his Epistle to the
            Ephesians that Paul was martyred, without <br />giving any further
            information.
          </p>
          <h2>Remains</h2>
          <p>
            According to further legend, Paul's body was buried outside the
            walls of Rome, at the second mile on the
            <br />Via Ostiensis, on the estate owned by a Christian woman named
            Lucina. It was here, in the fourth century, <br />that the Emperor
            Constantine the Great built a first church. Then, between the fourth
            and fifth centuries, <br />it was considerably enlarged by the
            Emperors Valentinian I, Valentinian II, Theodosius I, and Arcadius.
            <br />The present-day Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls was
            built there in the early 19th century. Caius <br />in his
            Disputation Against Proclus (198 AD) mentions this of the places in
            which the remains of the apostles <br />Peter and Paul were
            deposited: "I can point out the trophies of the apostles. For if you
            are willing to go <br />to the Vatican or to the Ostian Way, you
            will find the trophies of those who founded this Church".
