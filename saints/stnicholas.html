            St. Nicholas (15 March 270-6 December 343), also known as Nicholas
            of Bari, was an early Christian Bishop
            <br />of Greek Descent from the maritime city of Myra in Asia Minor
            during the time of the Roman Empire. Because <br />of the many
            miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as
            Nicholas the Wonderworker. St. <br />Nicholas is the patron saint of
            sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, prostitutes,
            children, <br />brewers, pawnbrokers, unmarried people and students
            in various cities and countries around Europe. His <br />reputation
            evolved among the faithful, as was common among early Christian
            Saints, and his legendary habit <br />of secret gift-giving gave
            rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Saint Nicholas.
          </p>
          <h2>Family and background</h2>
          <p>
            Accounts of Saint Nicholas's life agree on the essence of his story,
            but modern historians disagree
            <br />regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in
            historical fact. Traditionally, Nicholas <br />was born in the city
            of Patara (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in
            Asia Minor <br />in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek
            Christians. According to some accounts, his parents <br />were named
            Epiphanius and Johanna, but, according to others, they were named
            Theophanes and Nonna. <br />In some accounts, Nicholas's uncle was
            the bishop of the city of Myra, also in Lycia. Recognizing his
            <br />nephew's calling, Nicholas's uncle ordained him as a priest.
          </p>
          <h2>Generosity and travels</h2>
          <p>
            After his parents died, Nicholas is said to have distributed their
            wealth to the poor. In his most famous
            <br />exploit, which is first attested in Michael the
            Archimandrite's Life of Saint Nicholas, Nicholas heard of <br />a
            devout man who had once been wealthy but had lost all of his money
            due to the "plotting and envy of Satan." <br />The man could not
            afford proper dowries for his three daughters. Hearing of the girls'
            plight, Nicholas decided <br />to help them, but, being too modest
            to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of
            accepting <br />charity), he went to the house under the cover of
            night and threw a purse filled with gold coins through the
            <br />window opening into the house. The father immediately arranged
            a marriage for his first daughter, and after <br />her wedding,
            Nicholas threw a second bag of gold through the same window late at
            night.
          </p>
          <h2>Bishop of Myra</h2>
          <p>
            After visiting the Holy Land, Nicholas returned to Myra. The bishop
            of Myra, who had succeeded Nicholas's
            <br />uncle, had recently died and the priests in the city had
            decided that the first priest to enter the church <br />that morning
            would be made bishop. Nicholas went to the church to pray and was
            therefore proclaimed the new <br />bishop. He is said to have been
            imprisoned and tortured during the Great Persecution under the
            Emperor <br />Diocletian (ruled 284-305), but was released under the
            orders of the Emperor Constantine the Great (ruled <br />306-337).
            This story sounds plausible, but is not attested in the earliest
            sources and is therefore unlikely <br />to be historical. One of the
            earliest attested stories of Saint Nicholas is one in which he saves
            three innocent <br />men from execution. According to Michael the
            Archimandrite, three innocent men were condemned to death by the
            <br />governor Eustathius. As they were about to be executed,
            Nicholas appeared, pushed the executioner's sword to the
            <br />ground, released them from their chains, and angrily chastised
            a juror who had accepted a bribe.
          </p>
          <h2>Other Reputed Miracles</h2>
          <p>
            One story tells how during a terrible famine, a malicious butcher
            lured three little children into his house,
            <br />where he killed them, placing their remains in a barrel to
            cure, planning to sell them off as ham. Nicholas, <br />visiting the
            region to care for the hungry, saw through the butcher's lies and
            resurrected the pickled children <br />by making the Sign of the
            Cross. Jona Lendering states that the story is "without any
            historical value." Adam <br />C. English notes that the story of the
            resurrection of the pickled children is a late medieval addition to
            the <br />legendary biography of Saint Nicholas and that it is not
            found in any of his earliest Lives. Though this story <br />seems
            bizarre and horrifying to modern audiences, it was tremendously
            popular throughout the late Middle Ages <br />and the Early Modern
            Period and widely beloved by ordinary folk. It is depicted in
            stained glass windows, wood <br />panel paintings, tapestries, and
            frescoes.
          </p>
          <h2>Relics</h2>
          <p>
            It has long been traditionally assumed that Saint Nicholas was
            originally buried in his home town of Myra,
            <br />where his relics are later known to have been kept, but some
            recent archaeological evidence indicates that <br />Saint Nicholas
            may have originally been entombed in a rock-cut church located at
            the highest point on the <br />small Turkish island of Gemile, only
            twenty miles away from his birthplace of Patara. Nicholas's name is
            <br />painted on part of the ruined building. In antiquity, the
            island was known as "Saint Nicholas Island" and <br />today it is
            known in Turkish as Gemiler Adasi, meaning "Island of Boats", in
            reference to Saint Nicholas's <br />traditional role as the patron
            saint of seafarers. The church was built in the fourth century,
            around the <br />time of Nicholas's death, and is typical of saints'
            shrines from that time period. Nicholas was the only <br />major
            saint associated with that part of Turkey. The church where
            historians believe he was originally <br />entombed is at the
            western end of the great processional way.
