            Kuriakose Elias Chavara, C.M.I. (10 February 1805 - 3 January 1871)
            was an Indian Syro-Malabar Catholic
            <br />priest, philosopher and social reformer. He is the first
            canonised Catholic male saint of Indian origin <br />and belongs to
            the Syro-Malabar Church, an Eastern Catholic Church based in the
            state of Kerala. He was <br />the co-founder and first Prior General
            of the first congregation for men in the Syro-Malabar Church, now
            <br />known as the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (C.M.I.), and of a
            similar one for women, the Congregation of <br />the Mother of
            Carmel (C.M.C.). He is a pioneer in many fields.
          </p>
          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Kuriakose Elias Chavara was born on 10 February 1805 at Kainakary,
            Kerala in a Nasrani Christian family
            <br />as the son of Iko (Kuriakose) Chavara and Mariam Thoppil.
            Nasranis are Saint Thomas Christians (also <br />known as Syriac
            Christians) who are the ancient Christians of Kerala baptised by
            Thomas the Apostle in <br />the first century. The name Kuriakose is
            derived from the Syriac Aramaic name Quriaqos. He was baptised
            <br />on 17 February 1805 at St. Joseph's Syro-Malabar Catholic
            Church, Chennamkary. On 8 September 1805, Chavara <br />was
            dedicated to Blessed Virgin Mary at St. Mary's Church, Vechoor. The
            Chavara family has derived from <br />the ancient Nasrani family
            Meenappally in Kainakary.
          </p>
          <h2>Later Life</h2>
          <p>
            Kuriakose Elias Chavara joined with two other priests, Palackal
            Thoma Malpan and Porukara Thoma Kathanar
            <br />
            to lead a monastic life. The name of the community they founded was
            Servants of Mary Immaculate. The <br />
            foundation for the first monastery at Mannanam was laid on 11 May
            1831 by Porukara Thomas Kathanar. Palackal <br />
            Malpan and Porukara Kathanar died in 1841 and 1846 respectively. On
            8 December 1855, Kuriakose Elias Chavara <br />
            and ten other priests took vows in the Carmelite tradition. He was
            nominated as the Prior General of Mannanam <br />
            monastery. The congregation became affiliated as a Third Order
            institute of the Order of Discalced Carmelites. <br />
            From that point on they used the postnominal initials of T.O.C.D.
          </p>
          <h2>Social reformer</h2>
          <p>
            Kuriakose Chavara started an institution for Sanskrit studies at
            Mannanam in 1846. A tutor belonging to
            <br />the Variar community was brought from Thrissur, to teach at
            this Sanskrit institution. After establishing <br />the Sanskrit
            institution in Mannanam, Chavara took the initiative to start a
            school in a nearby village <br />called Arpookara. On this
            Parappurath Varkey wrote in the Chronicles of the Mannanam
            monastery: "While the <br />work on the Mannanam School began, a
            place on the Arpookara Thuruthumali hill was located to build a
            <br />Chapeland school for the converts from the Pulaya caste."
            Chavara was the first Indian who not only <br />dared to admit the
            untouchables to schools but also provided them with Sanskrit
            education which was forbidden <br />to the lower castes, thereby
            challenging social bans based on caste, as early as the former part
            of the <br />19th century.
          </p>
          <h2>Congregations Founded</h2>
          <p>
            In co-operation with Palackal Thoma Malpan and Thoma Porukara,
            Kuriakose Elias Chavara founded an
            <br />Indian religious congregation for men, now known as the
            Carmelites of Mary Immaculate. Chavara took <br />religious vows on
            8 December 1855 and took the name of Kuriakose Elias of the Holy
            Family. Kuriakose <br />Elias Chavara was the Prior General of all
            the monasteries of the congregation from 1856 till his <br />death
            in 1871.He was commonly called under the name 'Common Prior'. The
            activities of the members <br />of CMI congregation under the
            leadership of Chavara created huge transformation in the society.
            This <br />made priests and people to request Chavara to open
            religious houses in their area. He established seven <br />new
            monasteries besides Mannanam. They are Koonammavu-1857,
            Elthuruth-(St. Aloysius College, Thrissur) <br />1858, Plasnal-1858,
            Vazhakulam-1859, Pulincunnu-1861, Ambazhakad-1868, and Mutholy-1870.
            In 1864, The <br />Vicar Apostolic transferred St.Chavara to
            Koonammavu Monastery.
          </p>
          <h2>Prior Mango</h2>
          <p>
            Prior Mango is a variety of mango which Kuriakose Chavara
            popularised. It is named after him who was
            <br />endearingly called "Prior" based on his position as the Prior
            or head of the religious congregation. <br />At Mannanam monastery
            there was a mango tree which was planted and taken care of by
            Kuriakose Chavara. <br />He sent the mango seedlings to monasteries
            and convents and told the members: Please plant the sapling <br />of
            this sweet mango, which I name it as 'Dukran'(Orma = memory) in each
            of our monastery. "This is to <br />make you realize that myself and
            all men are weak and faltering and don't have long life even as
            these <br />mango trees which give sweet fruits." In a letter he
            wrote : " This Mango-tree (1870) and its seedlings <br />leave a
            loving patrimonial memory for us".
          </p>
          <h2>Death and Miracles</h2>
          <p>
            Kuriakose Elias Chavara died on 3 January 1871, aged 66, at
            Koonammavu. He was buried in St.Philomena's
            <br />Forane Church, Koonammavu. His body was later moved to St.
            Joseph's Monastery Church in Mannanam. His <br />memorial is
            celebrated on 3 January as per the Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar.
            whereas his memorial is <br />celebrated on 18 February as per the
            Roman Liturgical Calendar of the Latin Rite. The following were the
            <br />last words of Kuriakose Chavara: "Why are you sad? All God's
            people must die some day. My hour has come. <br />By the grace of
            God, I prepared myself for it since long." Scores of miraculous
            favours were reported by <br />the intercession of Kuriakose
            Chavara. Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception, who later became the
            first <br />saint of India, has testified in 1936 that Kuriakose
            Elias Chavara had appeared to her twice during her <br />illness and
            relieved her suffering.
