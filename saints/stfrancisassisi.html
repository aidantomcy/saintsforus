            St. Francis of Assisi (1181 or 1182-3 October 1226) was an Italian
            Catholic Friar, deacon, <br />mystic and preacher. He founded the
            men's Order of Friars Minor, the women's Order <br />of Saint Clare,
            the Third Order of St. Francis and the Custody of the Holy Land.
            Francis is <br />one of the most venerated religious figures in
            Christianity. He was canonized by Pope <br />Gregory IX on 16 July
            1228. Francis is known for his love of the Eucharist. In 1223,
            Francis <br />Francis arranged for the first Christmas Live nativity
            scene.
          </p>
          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <p>
            Francis of Assisi was born in late 1181 or early 1182, one of
            several children of an <br />Italian father, Pietro di Bernardone
            dei Moriconi, a prosperous silk merchant, and a <br />French mother,
            Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except that she was a
            <br />noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on
            business when Francis was <br />born in Assisi, and Pica had him
            baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro <br />took
            to calling his son Francesco ("Free man", "Frenchman"), possibly in
            honor of his <br />commercial success and enthusiasm for all things
            French.
          </p>

          <h2>Founding of the Franciscan Orders</h2>
          <p>
            One morning in February 1208, Francis was taking part in a Mass in
            the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, <br />near which he had by
            then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the
            "Commissioning of the Twelve" <br />from the Book of Matthew. The
            disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand.
            Francis <br />was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty.
            Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then <br />worn by
            the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around himself with a
            knotted rope and went about exhorting <br />the people of the
            countryside to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis's
            preaching to ordinary people <br />was unusual as he had no license
            to do so. His example attracted others. Within a year Francis had
            eleven <br />followers. The brothers lived a simple life in the
            deserted lazar house of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they <br />spent
            much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of
            Umbria, making a deep impression upon <br />their hearers by their
            earnest exhortations.
          </p>
          <h2>Travels</h2>
          <p>
            Determined to bring the Gospel to all peoples and let God convert
            them, Francis sought on several occasions <br />to take his message
            out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem,
            but was shipwrecked <br />by a storm on the Dalmatian coast, forcing
            him to return to Italy. On 8 May 1213, he was given the use of
            <br />the mountain of La Verna (Alverna) as a gift from Count
            Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as "eminently <br />suitable for
            whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind". The
            mountain would become one of <br />his favourite retreats for
            prayer. In the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but an illness
            forced him <br />to break off his journey while in Spain.
          </p>
          <h2>Reorganization of the Franciscan Order</h2>
          <p>
            The growing order of friars was divided into provinces; groups were
            sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and
            <br />Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the
            martyrdom of five brothers in Morocco, Francis returned <br />to
            Italy via Venice. Cardinal Ugolino di Conti was then nominated by
            the pope as the protector of the order. <br />Another reason for
            Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at
            an unprecedented rate <br />compared to previous religious orders,
            but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this
            growth <br />and had little more to govern it than Francis' example
            and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared <br />a
            new and more detailed Rule, the "First Rule" or "Rule Without a
            Papal Bull" (Regula prima, Regula non bullata), <br />which again
            asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it
            also introduced greater institutional <br />structure, though this
            was never officially endorsed by the pope.
          </p>
          <h2>Stigmata, final days, and sainthood</h2>
          <p>
            While he was praying on the mountain of Verna, during a forty-day
            fast in preparation for Michaelmas (29 September),
            <br />Francis is said to have had a vision on or about 13 September
            1224, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, as a <br />result of
            which he received the stigmata. Brother Leo, who had been with
            Francis at the time, left a clear and simple <br />account of the
            event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata.
            "Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, <br />a six-winged angel on a
            cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ."
            Suffering from these stigmata <br />and from trachoma, Francis
            received care in several cities (Siena, Cortona, Nocera) to no
            avail. In the end, he was brought <br />back to a hut next to the
            Porziuncola. Here he spent his last days dictating his spiritual
            testament. He died on the evening <br />of Saturday, 3 October 1226,
            singing Psalm 141, <em>"Voce mea ad Dominum"</em>.
          </p>
          <h2>Patronage</h2>
          <p>
            On 18 June 1939, Pope Pius XII named Francis a joint Patron Saint of
            Italy along with Catherine of Siena
            <br />with the apostolic letter "Licet Commissa". Pope Pius also
            mentioned the two saints in the laudative discourse <br />he
            pronounced on 5 May 1949, in the Church of Santa Maria Sopra
            Minerva. Francis is the patron of animals, merchants, <br />and
            ecology. He is also considered the patron against dying alone;
            against fire; patron of the Franciscan Order and <br />Catholic
            Action; of families, peace, needleworkers, and merchants, and a
            number of religious congregations. He is the <br />patron of many
            churches and other locations around the world, including: Italy; San
            Pawl il-Bahar, Malta; Freising, <br />Germany; Lancaster, England;
            Kottapuram, India; San Francisco de Malabon, Philippines (General
            Trias City); San Francisco, <br />California; Santa Fe, New Mexico;
            Colorado; Salina, Kansas; Metuchen, New Jersey; and Quibdó,
            Colombia.
